/**
 * Shared Components
 *
 * This directory contains reusable components that are shared across multiple screens.
 *
 * Organization:
 * - Each component should have its own directory
 * - Include index.tsx (component), style.ts (styles), and types (if needed)
 * - Export components from this index file for easy importing
 *
 * Usage example:
 * import { Button, Card } from '@components';
 */

// Export your shared components here
// export { default as Button } from './Button';
// export { default as Card } from './Card';

export {};
